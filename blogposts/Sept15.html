			<h2>Color Theory in Christmas #ConceptMap</h2>
			<h5>Sep 15, 2023</h5>
			<p>While the reading today talked about colors and personal colors, there has been something else on my mind Christmas. Lkely cause of the color scheme within the dorm (an attempt at wine and deep teal), I can never seem to escape it. And with it came the thought: do the colors of Christmas match what it means?</p>
			<p>The first thing I did for this was to roughly map out some holidays to some colors as well as ideas. The image is that below.</p>
			<img src="/images/bloposts/916-conceptmap.jpg" alt="Concept Holiday map">

			<p>What I came up with was that, outside of relgion, Christmas is red and dark green with the ideas of family, joy, and warmth. The red brings in the idea of warmth and passion and hints at the idea of love being present. The darker greens are associated with hopefulness, wealth, and comfort. In terms of Christmas, this color offsets the red as complimentary colors as well as represents the idea of home. </p>
