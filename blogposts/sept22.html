		<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one, but ever since I was a kid, colort palettes fascinate me. The cohesiveness, the striking colors, I am the type to by eye shadows just because the colors match. Now, while the internet has plenty of color palettes, I have realized that not all of them are good. Frequently the colors don't have enough contrast, are too saturated, are too high or low value, and desiging with them.That's where we get into today's video.</p>
		<p>The video explains how to get a color on a gradient. Something I find really practical because I generally click the color and pray I'm getting it dark enough. The trick of using black or white maintains the hue of the color while also providing a larger range of colros to see and select over. I also like the idea of seeing it compared to the current color already. I expect to be using this a lot in the upcoming homeworks!</p>
