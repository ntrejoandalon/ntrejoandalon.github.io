	<h2>Am I Next, an Inspiration</h2>
	<h5>Oct 8, 2023</h5>


	<div class = "blog-post">
        <p>The first thing I saw when visiting the Sheldon stuck with me. Partially because of placement, and other reasons I’ll discuss later, the orange LED sign with the words “Am I Next?” stole my attention that day. In the dark of the next room, it glowed, casting an ominous glow across the marble. The words were sloppily done, jagged, and sloping from one letter to the next. It demanded attention, placed squarely between the doorway. Even when leaving that exhibit, the last thing I saw was the reflection across the glass door, my own shadow haunting as I walked away.</p>
        <p>	The work was a recreation of a sign held in protest. The words, “Am I Next?” is a slogan and name for a movement centering around gender-based violence in South Africa as well as used in civil rights demonstrations. The lightbox itself uses a drawing of a photograph taken by Demetrius Washington in Ferguson, Missouri. In it, it focuses on a man protesting with the same sign. This photo was taken after a police killing of an unnamed Black teenager. The work itself is made by Sam Durant using an electronic sign with vinyl text.</p>
        <h5>Placement</h5>
        <p>	What drew me to it was the placement. No matter where I looked in the first two rooms of the gallery, I could see it out of the corner of my eye. It seated right at the beginning making the question feel like a hypothetical but more of an eventuality. It wasn’t a question of avoiding it, it needs to be addressed. With that, it gave a sense of the paranoia and fear that can come with discrimination. </p>
        <p>	While that can’t be related directly to an interface, it does touch on a central idea: placement. In this case, placement of a call to action. Frequently calls to action are buttons. In this case, there should only be one primary button or attention-grabbing feature, as described in the article in Medium, “A Complete Guide to Call to Action Design”. This minimizes confusion and funnels attention more effectively towards the goal. </p>
        <h5>Color</h5>
        <p>	The lightbox has two colors: neon orange and black. Using neon orange as the backdrop, the black text stands out almost forebodingly. It takes advantage of the high contrast to make its point, quite literally, loud and clear. Contrast is something that is the staple of clear design as it allows the user to be able to see and navigate around a design. While the contrast here comes from the black against the brightness of the orange, there are more ways to have contrast between colors. A blog post from Halo Lab explains this, siting four ways to have contrast: dark and light colors, different saturation, different hues, and a difference in temperature. This work used different hues as well as different values of light and dark. </p>
        <h5>Typography</h5>
        <p>	The words on the lightbox work for two reasons: content and design. The words themselves are evocative, capable of humanizing atrocities in the framing of dread and fear. That said, they are supported by the design of the text itself. The first two words are in capital letters on the top line with the following line having the last word running into itself almost and more connected. The question mark caps it off with the period ending far below the word “next”. The lightbox plays with both line spacing and letter shape to give the words effect.</p>
        <p> The article, ‘The Psychology of Logo Design: How Fonts, Colors, Shapes and Lines Influence Purchasing Decisions” by Katie Lundin, it discusses how thick and thin lines are interpreted. Thick lines express strength and are used to draw focus and create emphasis. Thin lines can imply frailty or weakness. It also talks about straight versus curved lines, with straight lines implying structure and harshness and curved lines having more energy and reactivity. While we are discussing type, it is based off human writing and consists of lines, leading the effects to still remain similar. The blocky straightness of the first line’s capital letters draws the viewer in while implying the harshness of the question. The last line consists of more curved lines, applying a human element as well as giving a more fragile feeling. It’s almost as if it’s a realization of the text itself as it ponders the question.</p>
        <h5>Sketches</h5>
        <p> With all of that said, here is a sketch of a user interface based off the artwork</p>
        <img src="/images/bloposts/aminextimage.jpg" alt="Initial slide">
        <p>It draws on the differences in font to establish a clear hierarchy. The general subject is centered and in large blocky text, drawing the eye. The subtitle is italicized and smaller, meant to add a more human element to the page in the same style as the original lightbox. The call to action is a button below it, once again with blocky text. To make it stand out, it also uses color contrast. Using the suggestion from the “Complete Guide to Call to Action” the button itself is blue, and in keeping with the inspiration, a bright blue. This contrasts against the warmer-toned white background. The nav bar is a less saturated dark indigo, keeping the focus on the button. As for placement, the key information is centered to fully use the space of the page itself. The button is two-thirds down, but still under the heading where it would be seen when a user scans the page. The interface as a whole is an anti-smoking website that is searching for donations or volunteers to help. </p>
