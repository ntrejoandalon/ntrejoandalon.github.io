		<p>Header bars have been on my brain a lot recently. Mostly due to Design Studio, but I have spent an unreasonable amount of time thinking what should and shouldn't be on it. In theory it's simple: the logo, navigation (bar or menu). Though according to the book, focus on minimizing unused space on screen s to help with the content flow in the page. Below is a rough mockup that doesn't use that concept.</p>

        <p>In this image, the main issue is the redundancy of the color bar as well as the blank space at the end of the logo. It takes up real estate on the screen as well as makes it feel unbalanced.  </p>
