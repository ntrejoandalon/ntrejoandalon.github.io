		<p>The first comic in Don't Make Me Think hits a little bit too close to home. In Design Studio at the moment, we are designing the front end of a website and a lot of the conversations we get into sound similar to that pictured above. We are trying to get user testing done, moreso to move on as well as have something usable and not built directly for us. We have had more focus group testing and not really user testing as we describe in the abstract what should and should not be happening. Maybe it would be useful, since we are having issues directly having customer interaction, to do the do-it-yourself testing. In it, it's a loose recruitment of people and while it is not exact, it's better than ntohing.</p>
