        <p>One of the hardest part of PowerPoints, is figuring out how to place text over an image or two different colors. It's a balancing act of getting enough contrast that it is readable, but making sure the image is still visible as well. The text provides a good solution, having a section with low opacity the text lies upon. It gives the text a single color to contrast against, making it easier to work with. This is different from what I getneraly do which is darken the whole image and place white text to show distance.</p>
