		<p>Recently, I have been remaking my portfolio at the moment. You can't see the changes right now, but it has left me wondering a lot about how to show the content and what way is best for the user. In particular, how am I going to display the blogposts and the progress on the final project. For example, I have a prety clear idea for the dashboard, but I am pretty sure I need to implement other pages to provide a search and filter feature. That's especially true for the blogpost section as I display very few of them at a time with that size. I recognize it could be annoying and am trying to design around it. In summary, I have been the person chanting: overview, search and filter, details on demand, and I'm trying to make the new version of my portfolio easier to navigate as well as nicer to look at.</p>
