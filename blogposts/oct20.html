		<p>I have been hearing a lot of difference between prioritisation of tasks. For one, it's do what has the most amount of value for least amount of work. For this, it is choosing the most serious problems and working down. Both make sense, but it's odd as I would have expected the development to have the most, find the most needed item first. That was interesting enough, and perhaps for UI doing the most serious isn't as problematic if it goes long. Regardless, the breaking down of tasks across the two remain the same.</p>
