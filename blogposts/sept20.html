	<h2>Resumes and Text Hierarchy</h2>
	<h5>Sep 20, 2023</h5>

	<div class = "blog-post">
		<p>It's the season of resumes! And with that comes the constant redesigning and updating of previous resumes. The goal: getting people to get the information quickly, and that's where it ties in with today's readings.</p>
		<p>Consistency is incredibly important in resumes, be that phrasing, structure, or text style. For this example today, we're focusing on text hierarchy. Text hierarchy is the structure of the text and relationships between one another. It frequently is made using different headings, sizes, to indicate importance as well as laying out more important items at the top of the paper. The reason I'm bringing this up is the readability aspect. Having a cl4ear hierarchy makes the resume easier to read as well as navigate, something incredibly important in the few seconds they look at it. So the next time you are looking to make changes, check the headings. See if the eye is flowing where you want it and that the headings match, are cohesive, and get gradually less important. </p>
