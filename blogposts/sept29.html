		<p>The summary of this reading was honesty. Not saying rude things under the veneer of honesty, but truthfullness. No one goes into feedback wanting to get lied to, and trying to spare feelings might end up condescending instead. As it said, the idea of sandwhiching feedback has become cheap as it feels less genuine and more of a stepping stone to go to what matters. So how do we make if feel less cruel, keep it seperate. A big thing is remembering that your design isn't you and that a criticism to it isn't against you. Also, while honesty can be about negative things, it is also about the positives. Make sure to say what people are doing good, when appropriate, and narrow it down so they can do it again.</p>

        <p>This reading serves as a great reminder, it doesn't matter how nicely you say it, people can tell when you're being fake with them. And one of the best ways to gain trust, thoughtful honesty.</p>
