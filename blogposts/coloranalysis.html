	<h2>Clicker Heroes and Color Analysis</h2>
	<h5>Sep 18, 2023</h5>

	<div class = "blog-post">
		<p>For this color analysis, we are looking at the game Clicker Heroes. Clicker Heroes is a never-ending idle game made in 2014 available on Steam. It is a single-screen game where the user upgrades their heroes to fight through increasing levels of monsters. A screenshot is provided below for reference.</p>

		<p>For the purpose of this analysis, this has been simplified and mocked up in Figma. The results are below. The grey triangle and platform aren’t indicative of color but instead how often the colors change and are unable to be pinned down. The rough mock-up is below.</p>

		<p>While the game doesn’t follow a traditional color palette, it most closely follows complimentary. In this, the two colors the blue and brown, with brown taking the place of orange. This could work as brown is frequently a high-value form of orange. That is in fact how the mock-up got to the color. When designing this, the creators intended to give it a very medieval feeling. The brown is supposed to be reminiscent of wood while the non-gilded (yellow) characters are more of a parchment color. Overall though, it feels all over the place with buttons in multiple situations and random colors such as the green and red appearing. </p>

		<p>For the next color palette, we have a triad. This one was selected because Clicker Heroes is a child-friendly game. The screenshot is below.            </p>

		<p>In this screenshot, the design elements are primarily in blues, reds, and yellows. The character upgrades remain as yellow, the blue is the background, and the red is used as an accent. This color scheme makes it feel more rudimentary and abstract. It doesn’t help with the aesthetic the original designers went for nor does it add any other type of charm.             </p>
		<p>The next palette is analogous. It uses primarily blues with some green and purple. The color palette is less concentrated and is shown below.</p>

		<p>The biggest strength of this palette is its cohesiveness. Everything falls on the cooler side of the color wheel which gives it a more together look. I tend to call this one the snow and ice version. The bits of white and the blues make the game feel colder and less forgiving.  However, it doesn’t give a strong sense of combat or progression which goes against the idea of the game’s progression.</p>
	
		<p>The next palette, and my personal favorite, is the split complementary. In this case, it is using yellow-orange, violet, and yellow-green. This color palette is marked below.</p>

		<p>With the black, this palette gives a very Halloween atmosphere. It doesn’t make the game more menacing, but more so adds a festive type flair, marking it as something fun but also dealing with something spooky (in this case monsters). The downside of this palette is the brightness of its colors. It is very jarring on the eyes, something that makes it so attention-grabbing.</p>
		<p>My personal favorite amongst the four, and the one I find most effective is the split complimentary. It would likely need adjustments as all of the colors are very saturated and fight against the eyes, but it is attention-grabbing and semi-cohesive. The colors together give a Halloween-like sentiment which is fitting to a game centered around monsters and fighting monsters.</p>
