			<h2>Designing Rules for PowerPoints</h2>
			<h5>Sep 6, 2023</h5>
			<p>Within this blogpost, we will be taking the slide below and making it more user friendly adapting the ideas for web design!</p>

			<p>1. Remove distractions
				One major issue with the slide is the amount of colors, images, and differing sizes. There's a lot going on this slide and it's difficult to tell what is important. Let's remove some of that and see what it would look cleaned up. 
				
				Here is the same slide with less distractions.</p>

			<p>2. Remove unneccessary words
				That looks better but see the amount of text on that slide Who is going to read that. Excess text makes the slide harder to read as well as less appealing. A common rule for powerpoints is the seven seven seven rule. Seven words in seven lines readable at seven feet away. Another approach recommended in the book, remove half of the words.
				
				Here is the same slide with the text reduced.</p>

			<p>3. Text hierarchy 
				Now, all the text is the same size. While it looks okay, changing the font size and boldness relative to its importance. 
				
				Here is the same slide with a text hierarchy.</p>
