		<p>Looking though the portfolio's, there was one thing clear. I need to be thinking about what to add and show and in what order. I particularly like what they said about visiters. They care about seeing the process and work because that's what the website about. An easy solution would be pushing blogposts further down, something I hadn't considered yet. In the future I'll think more about the user and what they wat as well as the design of the blogpost.a</p>
