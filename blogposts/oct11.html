        <p>At this point, I've determined that Figma will be my defining skill by the end of the semester. Between the final project, design studio, and the redesign, I have spent a lot of hours creating components and adjusting design. I always thought that prototyping would be difficult, in IP I was in the Adobe camp, and that it would take up at least a week of time. Turns out, it is as simple as dragging the arrows across and setting an animation if necessary. It's a verb pleasent suprise about it and something I hope to use extensively when handling on click, on hover event. And while I have always seen figma as a static object, maybe with this all the designs can almost take a life of their own.</p>
