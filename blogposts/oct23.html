	<h2>VSCode and Accessibility </h2>
	<h5>Oct 23, 2023</h5>
	<h6>Directed Analysis</h6>

	<div class = "blog-post">
		<p>Within the reading, Krug states that accessible design is necessary as we can't expect none of our users to have an alternate requirement. Now, with that in mind, he states the best way to improve a site's accessibility for people that need alternate requirements is to improve it for everyone. In his own words, if someone has issues with 
			a site and they don't need additional features, someone that does will still have difficulty following. </p>
		<p>In this blogpost we're going to take some of the relevant suggestions Krug makes and apply them onto Visual Studio Code to see how accessible it is. </p>
		<p>1. Make all content accessible by keyboard</p>
		<p>Now this is something that is possible in VSCode as well as is recommended as it speeds up programming. Below is a list of shortcuts that VSCode supports. 		</p>

		<p>While it is difficult to know these by memory which could make it more frustrating to users. However it does fufill this requirement. </p>
		<p>2. Create significant contrast between text and background</p>
		<p>This is something that VSCode does well as it has a dark, light, and high contrast mode, each pictured below. It also has the option to have a custom "theme" which changes the colors of the text and thus allowing more contrast as well as accessibility for color blindness.</p>

		<p>3. Increasing text size increases other elements.</p>
		<p>I could not find a button to increase text size however, using Ctrl + I was able to zoom in and out. With it, the side bars and botto bars also grew in size, fufilling this requirement. Below is the result of a zoom in. </p>

		<p>Overall, VSCode is fairly accessible though getting used to the structure as well as the keyboard shortcuts will take a bit for common users.</p>
